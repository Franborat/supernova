"""The merge's decode-pool unclamp, and the lanes decision that replaced the probe.

THE DECODE POOL. pyarrow takes its CPU-pool default from OMP_NUM_THREADS, and a
GPU-only Ray/SkyPilot task gets OMP_NUM_THREADS=1, so the pool is ONE thread and
every reader thread in the reduce queues behind it. Measured on the production
32 x 4.04 GB dense partials, raising it alone took dense `reduce_s` 434.2 -> 218.7
and `io_wait_s` 263.6 -> 32.0. It presents as an IO bottleneck -- idle CPU, flat
throughput however you tune the GET concurrency -- so nothing about it is
self-announcing, which is why it needs a test rather than a comment.

THE LANES DECISION. `lanes_mode` used to be decided by a PREFETCH of rank 0's
whole `hit_ids` column before the reduce; it now comes from the first partial
the reduce fetches anyway. The property that makes that safe is that `lanes_mode`
picks an id REPRESENTATION and not a ranking, so either choice must produce
identical hits. `tests/parity` asserts this only under CUDA, so on a CPU-only
machine nothing checked it -- these tests do, via NOVA_BF_MERGE_FOLD=cpu.
