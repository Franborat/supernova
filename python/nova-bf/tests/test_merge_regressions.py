"""Regression tests for the partial-major reduce in `merge._reduce`.

Concurrency / resource / failure-mode invariants. Each test below started life
as a reproducer for a defect found in review; they are inverted here
to pin the fixed behaviour, so a regression fails loudly rather than silently
returning the old shape. Every test that could hang runs the merge on a watchdog
thread and fails on timeout rather than blocking the suite.
